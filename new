Hi, I'm the author of /u/reply-guy-bot, a bot that searches reddit for comment plagiarists and replies with evidence against them.

As a one-time event, I'm reaching out the the mods of the subreddits I'm banned from to open a dialogue about unbanning my bot.

I'm sure many of you banned me for reasons that aren't going to change (a plain dislike of too many comments, apathy toward karma boosting, collaboration with karma boosters, etc.).

But some bans might be for reasons that may not apply anymore (my early versions misbehaved, mods banned the wrong user by accident, new leadership might care more about subreddit integrity).

If that's the case, or if there's a small change I could make to how I interact with your sub that would make it more palatable, please reply!

Thanks!
